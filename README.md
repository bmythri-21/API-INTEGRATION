# API-INTEGRATION















#

This is a responsive web application that fetches and displays real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It demonstrates how to integrate a public RESTful API into a modern web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app dynamically loads weather data based on user input (city name) and presents it in a clean and mobile-friendly layout.
